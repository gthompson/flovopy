# flovopy312.yml
# Note the following are not compatible with this Python 3.12 version of flovopy YML, which is the recommended Python as of August 2025:
# - pyrocko requires python 3.10 and generally needs to be installed first
# - passoft requires python 3.9 or 3.10, but is verified to work with flovopy on 3.10
# - ispaq requires python 3.8
# It might be possible to build these from source code (github repos), if really needed in same env
