    "# Amplitude Source Location (ASL)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Review\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorial, we estimated Reduced Displacement by assuming a source location, e.g. the summit of a volcano. But it would be better if we locate volcano-seismic signals, and then compute Reduced Displacement. Most volcano-seismic signals cannot be located using traditional differential travel-time techniques, because they lack identifiable phases (sources are quasi-continuous, so phases are arriving all the time). So what else can we do?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Motivation\n",
    "In summer 1996, I was fortunate enough as a graduate student to be asked to assist the British Geological Survey in its monitoring of the Soufriere Hills Volcano, Montserrat. As part of \"Team Seismic\" at the Montserrat Volcano Observatory, our job was to provide 24-7 monitoring of the lava dome eruption, which had been continuous since October 1995. Crucially, this involved two-way radio communications with others working on the slopes of the volcano, and warning them of seismicity, especially pyroclastic flows [Add video here from Lauren's Journeys program]. \n",
    "\n",
    "I had the idea that we could use the RSAM data to locate seismicity continuously, on a map on a monitor in the Ops Room. I created a proof-of-concept, using the 60-s RSAM data (the 2.56-s RSAM data wasn't captured) to locate tremor. And then later applied it to triggered event files for rockfalls and pyroclastic flows. We will replicate that here using Displacement Seismic Amplitude Measurement data, which is like RSAM that has been instrument-corrected. For simplicity - and speed which was important for a real-time system - we ignore the vertical dimension (topography and station elevations ignored), and assume an isotropic, homogeneous half-space.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will run a simulation, to demonstrate that our location technique works, showing that we can simulate a set of source locations, and then recover them with our location technique. Then we will compute locations for real DSAM data, and then for a known pyroclastic flow signal. For the latter, we will use a 5-s moving window, which we shift by 1-s through the whole length of the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "I call the approach above \"naive\" ASL, because for simplicity (and speed, for real-time application) it ignores the vertical dimension, and assumes a homogeneous, isotropic half space (1-layer). It also considers the seismic source to be a point source, and assumes only one event is occurring at a time. In reality, pyroclastic flows cause multiple seismic sources per unit time, over an extended area, and this evolves with time as the flow moves downhill. Moreover, there can be numerous pyroclastic flows travelling down different flanks of the volcano at the same time, such as in a major dome collapse which may be comprised of dozens of pyroclastic flows that reach the coast. This ASL technique can only estimate an average location of all seismicity recorded in each time window.\n",
    "\n",
